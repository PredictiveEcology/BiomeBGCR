Windows & Linux

1.(Windows Only) Install RTools 4.0 from url 

2. Open the Biome-BGCR package project

3. Install Rcpp package in R using command : 

install.packages("Rcpp")

4. Build package 

Linux

Debugging the C++ code using Visual Studio Code can only be achieved under linux because of a limitation with gdb and Mingw64
(see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64723109/gdb-cant-debug-running-process-using-vs-code-but-can-through-command-line)

Debugging setup for Visual Studio Code :

1. Install Makefile-tools package

2. Open the BiomeBGCR/src folder as the root folder in Visual Studio Code

2. Create a launch configuration similar to :
{
	"name": "(gdb) Attach",
	"type": "cppdbg",
	"request": "attach",
	"program": "/usr/lib/rstudio/bin/rsession",
	"processId": "${command:pickProcess}",
	"MIMode": "gdb",
	"setupCommands": [
		{
			"description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
			"text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
			"ignoreFailures": true
		}
	]
}

3. Set the breakpoints in Visual Studio Code

4. Launch and attach the debugger to the rsession process after making sure the BiomeBGCR package is loaded

5. Execute the R code calling the BiomeBGCR package
