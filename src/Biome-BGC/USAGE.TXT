Notes on Usage Changes to Biome-BGC version 4.2


* Biome-BGC Now support a variety of command line options. Here is
	the usage statement:

usage: ./bgc {-l <logfile>} {-s | -v [0..4]} {-p} {-V} {-a} {-u | -g | -m} <ini file>

       -l <logfile> send output to logfile, overwrite old logfile
       -V print version number and build information and exit
       -p do alternate calculation for summary outputs (see USAGE.TXT)
       -a output ascii formated data
       -s run in silent mode, no standard out or error
       -v [0..4] set the verbosity level 
           0 ERROR - only report errors 
           1 WARN - also report warnings
           2 PROGRESS - also report basic progress information
           3 DETAIL - also report progress details (default level)
           4 DIAG - also print internal diagnostics
       -u Run in spin-up mode (over ride ini setting).
       -g Run in spin 'n go mode: do spinup and model in one run
       -m Run in model mode (over ride ini setting).
			 -n <ndepfile> use an external nitrogen deposition file.

* Notes about the verbosity (-v) flag.

	You can use either the numeric verbosity setting (0-4) or the
	associated keyword. The verbosity keywords are not case sensitive.

	Also, -v and -s shouldn't be used together. If they are, only the
	last one on the command line used.


* Notes on the logfile (-l) flag.

	Using both -l and -s will always result in an empty logfile being 
	created


* Summary output changes with the '-p' flag

	Using the '-p' flag slightly modifies the way some summary outputs
	are calculated. (changes taken from the pan-artic bgc variant)
	*	Annual Max LAI is really the annual max LAI, not some average.
	* Monthly Max LAI is really the monthly max LAI, not some average.
	* Monthly Average Snow water is a monthly delta.
	* Monthly Average Soil water content is monthly delta.

	All other summary variables are calculated the same way as previous
	versions.

* "Spin & Go" mode (and associated flags)
	'-g' will run the spinup and then the model all in one run. It will 
		NOT write a restart file, regardless of what your ini file says.
	'-u' will spinup the model and write the restart file, overridding
		your ini settings.
	'-m' will run the model and write output. Note that your ini must 
		have some output variables set or this will not work.

* Ascii output with the '-a' flag.
	Using this flag will produce tab delimited ascii output files with
	a .ascii extension. These files are ready to be imported into excel

* Nitrogen Deposition File with the '-n' flag.
	Use an external nitrogen file. It is formatted like the co2 file
	and there is an example file in co2/ndep.txt


## Build System Changes ##

* new 'make test' target. typing 'make test' from the src/ directory
	will make a clean build and then run the spinup and model for the 
	included input data for Missoula, MT, USA. This provides a quick 
	way to test that your build appears to run ok. Note that this does
	NOT validate the output data. It just tries to produce it.

* BiomeBGC can be built on Windows using Visual Studio (tested with 
	VS2003). Use the Solution file (.sln) in src/Visual Studio/bgclib
