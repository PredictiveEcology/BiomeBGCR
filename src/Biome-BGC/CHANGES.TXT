Development Notes for Biome BGC.
This file is a list of code/internal changes.

======
4.2 (Final Release)
======
* No changes from rc3

======
4.2rc3
======
* Fixed minor memory bugs in new ndep code.

* Added serveral fixes to build code on Win32.
* Added public domain getops.[ch] files for use on Win32
* Added Visual Studio solution file.

======
4.2rc2
======
* Fixed Spin & Go so that the '-g' flag actually works.

* IMPORTANT Corrected use of the co2 file. It now correctly looks
	up the value for the model year. Previously it simply used co2
	entries starting at the top of the co2 file.

* Added External Nitrogen Deposition File see USAGE.TXT for more
	information.

======
4.2rc1
======
*	Identical to last 4.2pre

======
4.2pre
======
* Added command line option support using getopts() to add functionality
	without breaking backwards compatibility. See USAGE.TXT for options.

*	Centralized header files bgc.h for libbgc pointbgc.h for pointbgc
	C source files now only need to include one header, all others get
	included automatically in the correct order.

* Added bgc_io.c for non-data I/O. Replaced all printf()s to stdout
	with the new wrapper function bgc_printf().

	### DO NOT Use printf/sprintf/fprintf for output/error messages
	###	Use bgc_printf() instead

*	bgc_printf() is for outputing information to standard out and errror
	it behaves similar to printf but with an extra first argument:

		int bgc_printf(VERBOSITY, "Message\n", ...);

	VERBOSITY is one of several defined keywords. You use the keyword
	appropriate to when your message should be printed.

		BV_ERROR:			For fatal error messages
		BV_WARN: 			For non-fatal warnings
		BV_PROGRESS:	For basic progress information
		BV_DETAIL:		For detailed progress information
		BV_DIAG:			For internal diagnostic/debug messages
	
	bgc_printf also supports logging functionality see USAGE.TXT
	for usage.

*	Replaced all DEBUG printf's with proper bgc_printf calls

* Merged Spinup code into main code to reduce code duplication
	merged spinup_bgc.c into bgc.c

* Added pan arctic summary output. Traditional behavior is set by
	signed char summary_sanity = INSANE ; in bgc()

	SANE behavior (pan-artic style) calculates these correclty:
	Maximum Monthly LAI
	End of month Snow Water
	End of month Sail Water content

	Also added new output_map variables
	+   output_map[641] = &summary->daily_et;
	+   output_map[642] = &summary->daily_outflow;
	+   output_map[643] = &summary->daily_evap;
	+   output_map[644] = &summary->daily_trans;
	+   output_map[645] = &summary->daily_soilw;
	+   output_map[646] = &summary->daily_snoww;

* Rewrote make files to not use version specific directories
* Added 'make test' to build then run a spinup and model test

* Moved all photosynthesis science code out of bgc.c and into 
	photosynthesis.c

* Corrected some sprintf formating to be more ANSI C standards 
	complient in prephenology.c

* Added tests/corrections for negative variables in radtrans.c and 
	metarr_init.c: (swavgfd,par,swabs_plaishade,parabs_plaishadei,dal)

* Added code to improve portability and standards compliance.

* Added 'make tools' to master makefile. This builds the restart 
	diff/view tool.

* Replaced floating point equality tests with tolerance tests.
	Global tolerance define: FLT_COND_TOL = 1e-10
	epc_init.c, sitec_init.c

* Various memory leak and pointer assignment fixes in pointbgc.c	

* Fix to prevent SEGFAULT on empty restart file in pointbgc.c

* Split output_init.c into output_ctrl.c and output_init.c
	output_ctrl.c reads the output controls from the ini file
	output_init.c initializes the output files

* Added 'spin-n-go' functionality. This mode '-g' flag will run both
	the model and the spinup without generating the restart file.
